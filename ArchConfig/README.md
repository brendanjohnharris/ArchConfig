# Arch
A personal guide/script for installing and configuring Arch (`./install.sh`) and my config files (`./.*`)

Everything in `install.sh` should be executed manually from the bootable install environment.
Then, everything in `setup.sh` can be executed automatically by this file as a shell script as the root user of the now installed Arch OS (before running, follow the few manual instructions given at the start of `setup.sh`).
